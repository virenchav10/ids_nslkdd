 🛡️ NSL-KDD Intrusion Detection System

A machine learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using the NSL-KDD dataset, implemented with **Random Forest**, **Isolation Forest**, and **Autoencoder** models, along with **SHAP explainability** for model interpretation.

 📌 Overview
This project builds and evaluates three detection models on the NSL-KDD dataset:
- Random Forest — Supervised learning for multi-class attack classification
- Isolation Forest — Unsupervised anomaly detection
- Autoencoder — Deep learning-based anomaly detection
- SHAP — Explains model predictions feature-by-feature

The system is designed to detect various attack categories (`DoS`, `Probe`, `R2L`, `U2R`) and can be extended for real-time intrusion detection.

 ⚙️ Features
✅ Multi-class attack detection  
✅ Supervised & unsupervised learning approaches  
✅ Model explainability using SHAP  
✅ Data preprocessing with `OneHotEncoder` & `StandardScaler`  
✅ Supports both manual data entry & CSV batch predictions  

 📊 Dataset — NSL-KDD
The NSL-KDD dataset is an improved version of the original KDD’99 dataset, addressing issues of redundancy and imbalance.

- Classes: Normal, DoS, Probe, R2L, U2R  
- Features: 41 features (protocol, service, flag, network stats, etc.)  
- Source: [NSL-KDD Dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html)

 📈 Model Training & Evaluation

Random Forest — Tuned using `GridSearchCV` for maximum F1-score
Isolation Forest — Configured for high recall in anomaly detection
Autoencoder — Dense neural network with reconstruction error thresholding

**Metrics Used:**

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-score
* Confusion Matrix

 🧠 Explainability with SHAP

SHAP values help visualize how each feature contributes to a prediction:

* **Positive SHAP value** → Feature pushes towards attack classification
* **Negative SHAP value** → Feature pushes towards normal classification

---

 📜 Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
* matplotlib, seaborn
* tensorflow / keras
* shap

Install all dependencies via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

 🏗 Future Improvements

* Real-time intrusion detection integration
* Dataset augmentation for zero-day attack simulation
* Model deployment with a Streamlit dashboard

I can also **add usage screenshots and SHAP plots** into the README so it looks more professional on GitHub.  
Do you want me to make a **version with example images** included? That would make your repo more attractive.
